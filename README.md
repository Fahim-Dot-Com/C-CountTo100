# C-CountTo100
📊 Count to 100 – C# Console App
This simple C# console application demonstrates how to use a for loop to count from 1 to 100. It's a great basic example for beginners learning about loops and control flow in C#.

## 🧠 What It Does
Starts at 1

Counts up to 100

Prints each number on a new line in the console.

## 💻 Code Example
```
using System;

namespace MyApplication
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
      {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
      }
    }
  }
}
```
🛠️ How to Run It
Open your terminal or IDE (like Visual Studio or VS Code).

Make sure the .NET SDK is installed (dotnet --version to check).

Navigate to the project folder.

Run the project with:
```
dotnet run
```
